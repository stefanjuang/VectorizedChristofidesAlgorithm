# Vectorized Christofides Algorithm

## Introduction
Imagine solving the complex Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with increased efficiency and speed—this groundbreaking capability is now achievable with our Vectorized Christofides Algorithm.
Traditional methods for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) often struggle with computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. These conventional approaches can be slow and computationally expensive, making real-time solutions nearly impossible.

The Vectorized Christofides Algorithm tackles this problem head-on. By leveraging vectorized operations, we’ve created a solution that significantly accelerates the process of finding near-optimal solutions to the TSP while maintaining high accuracy. This approach transforms a time-consuming task into a streamlined process that’s both fast and reliable.

## Approach
This program provides an efficient implementation of the Christofides algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python. It leverages vectorized operations for better performance and includes the following key steps:

- Merge Similar Nodes: Clusters similar nodes using DBSCAN to reduce the problem size, mapping original nodes to their clusters.
- Compute Distance Matrix: Generates a distance matrix adjusted for clusters with a lower jump cost between similar nodes.
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Constructs an MST from the distance matrix.
- Odd Degree Vertices: Identifies vertices with odd degrees in the MST.
- Minimum Weight Matching: Finds the minimum weight matching for the subgraph of odd degree vertices.
- Eulerian Circuit: Forms an Eulerian circuit by combining the MST and the matching edges.
- Hamiltonian Path: Extracts a Hamiltonian path from the Eulerian circuit to form a TSP solution.
